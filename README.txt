This case study deals with one specific approach to classification.
The goal is to set up a classifier such that when
it's presented with a new observation whose category is not known,
it will attempt to assign that observation to a category, or a class,
based on the observations for which it does know the true category.
This specific method is known as the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier,
or kNN for short.
